# Multiplayer Car Game Server

## Overview


This project is a multiplayer car game server implemented in Python, utilizing socket programming for real-time communication and MongoDB for database management.

### Components

- **Socket Programming**: The server utilizes Python's socket module for establishing connections and enabling real-time communication between multiple clients.
- **MongoDB Database Integration**: MongoDB is employed for storing and managing player data, including positions, scores, and other game-related information.
- **Multithreading**: Threading is implemented to handle multiple client connections concurrently, ensuring smooth gameplay experience for all players.
- **Player Data Management**: Functions for reading player data from the database, updating player information, and handling player disconnections are implemented to maintain game state consistency.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as database connection failures or client disconnections.

### Usage

To run the server, execute the server.py script. Ensure that MongoDB is properly configured and running.

```bash
python server.py
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB

### Getting Started

1. Install Python and MongoDB on your system if not already installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Configure MongoDB connection strings in the server.py script.
4. Run the server using the command mentioned above.


## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with game development using Python and Pygame. I strengthened my skills in object-oriented programming, graphics rendering, and event handling. Additionally, I learned about collision detection algorithms and game design principles, which are valuable for my career as a MERN full-stack developer.
